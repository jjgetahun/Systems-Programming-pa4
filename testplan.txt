    In our indexer program, we test for a single file argument, a directory argument with multiple files in it, a directory argument with multiple sub-directories, and a directory argument with multiple files and sub-directories. We have also accounted for there being multiple files with the same name, but in different directories, and directories with spaces in their name.
    An example of a directory with multiple files and subdirectories is "test1". Our indexer goes through "test1", along with all of its sub-directories, in search of files. The contents of these files, if they are alphanumeric, are outputted in JSON format, along with the number of occurrences of each word in the file.
